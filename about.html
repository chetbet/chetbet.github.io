      <h2>About Me / Channel</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone, I'm Cameron (also known as chetbet online). I'm a 23 year old computer science grad that likes to make YouTube videos for fun. I make videos about anything I really find interestingâ€”more recently about digital minimalism, technology, online culture, and book reviews.</p>
      <p>I started making videos because I watched a lot of productivity content while I was in college and realized that I didn't see enough channels that felt authentic and realistic. A lot of the content out there made it seem like you needed to grind 24/7 to reach your goals, which simply isn't true. I wanted to create content that I would watch myself!</p>

          <strong>Q:</strong> How often do you post videos?<br>
          <strong>A:</strong> I try to post every 2 weeks (unless life gets in the way).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Where can I follow you?<br>
          <strong>A:</strong> I don't keep up with a ton of social media (aside from GoodReads and Reddit), so your best bet is probably YouTube. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Q:</strong> Why did you start making YouTube videos?<br>
          <strong>A:</strong> I was inspired by the productivity content I saw in college, but I felt it was too unrealistic. I wanted to offer authentic content that encourages balance rather than nonstop grinding.

          <strong>Q:</strong> Who are your favorite YouTubers?<br>

          <li>
            <strong>Q:</strong> What's a fun fact about you?<br>
